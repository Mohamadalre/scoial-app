# Social Media Platform API ‚Äì Task 6

## üìå Project Description

This project is a secure social media backend API built with Node.js. It includes authentication features and allows users to manage posts, comments, and likes. The project follows best practices in structuring code, using middleware, and implementing validations.

## üéØ Objective

To build a safe and functional backend for a social media platform, including:

- Secure user authentication (JWT & Argon2)
- CRUD operations for users, posts, comments, and likes
- Proper data validation and middleware usage
- Token-based authorization

## üîí Notes on Security

- Use `JWT` and `Argon2` for authentication and password hashing.
- Validate that the user modifying or deleting a post/comment is the original author using `authorId` from DB vs `userId` from the token.

---

## üõ† Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (mongoose)
- JWT
- Argon2
- express-validator

## ‚úÖ Development Notes

- Use Postman to test all endpoints.
- Structure files as per the provided architecture.
- Utilize middleware and helper functions.
- Add inline comments for each route and middleware.
